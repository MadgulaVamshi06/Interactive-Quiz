The HTML file represents my approach to building a quiz application using React, reflecting my understanding and implementation of React components to structure the user interface
I utilized React hooks, particularly useState, to manage the application state efficiently, enabling functionalities such as tracking selected answers and displaying the quiz score dynamically.
Event handling was crucial in my version, as I implemented mechanisms to capture user interactions, including selecting answers and submitting the quiz, thereby enhancing the application's interactivity.
I prioritized conditional rendering in my approach, ensuring that the quiz interface adjusts dynamically based on the application state, thereby providing a seamless user experience
